# Ride-Control-System (Python + Qt5)

A lightweight **operator-first** control system that simulates an amusement-ride control panel. It synchronizes ride components, enforces safety protocols during routine and emergency operations, and provides clear operator feedback through a Qt5 desktop UI. The ride is a boat ride assumed to have 7 different scens included in it. 

<!-- > **Note:** This project formed part of a larger proposal that earned an **invitation to Universal Studios’ annual TMTDC competition**. -->

## Features

- **Start / Stop ride cycles** with pre-dispatch interlocks  
- **Selective boat stop** — hold a specific boat without halting the entire ride  
- **Boat position log** — live view + historical record for troubleshooting  
- **Maintenance bay access** — route or hold boats for inspection/service  
- **Emergency Stop (E-Stop)** with guarded recovery steps  
- **Operator console UI** with status indicators, timers, and event log
